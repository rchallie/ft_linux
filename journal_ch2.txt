Creation of partitions needed (2.4 in the Bible):
    [ $ fdisk /dev/sdb ] to go on the second disk 
    * fdisk commands :
        - "p" -> give information about the disk 
        - "n" -> create a new partition
        - "t" -> set the type of a partition
    * Entering in fdisk menu in remain memory (actually VM disk)
        - The device does not have a recognized partition table.

+ /boot partition :
    * Create a /boot partition to set kernel and booting informations.
        - (1) [ $ n ] -> (new) create a new partition)
        - (2) [ $ p ] -> (primary) config as a primary partition
        - (3) [ $ 1 ] -> set the partition number
        - (4) [ $ (PRESS ENTER) ] -> use the default first sector
        - (5) [ $ +200M ] -> set the last sector to : first sector + 1 Gigabyte
        - [ $ p ] show disk informations + partitions informations     
+ Swap partition :
    * Create a swap partition (A swap partition is an extension of the
      RAM, it's used if the RAM is overbooked, then it's not necessary
      but it increase the performance).
        - (1) [ $ n ] -> (new) create a new partition)
        - (2) [ $ p ] -> (primary) config as a primary partition
        - (3) [ $ 2 ] -> set the partition number
        - (4) [ $ (PRESS ENTER) ] -> use the default first sector
        - (5) [ $ +2G ] -> set the last sector to : first sector + 1 Gigabyte
        - [ $ p ] show disk informations + partitions informations     
        - (6) [ $ t ] -> (type) to change type of a partition (use partition 1
                         because it's the only one
        - [ $ L ] give a list of the types
        - (7) [ $ 82 ] -> to set the partition to "Linux swap partition"
        - [ $ p ] to check if ID is set to 82 and type to linux swap
+ Root partition :
    * (1) [ $ n ] -> create new partition
    * (2) [ $ p ] -> primary partition
    * (3) [ $ 3 ] -> partition number
    * (4) [ $ (PRESS ENTER) ] -> use the default first sector
    * (5) [ $ +20G ] -> to set the last sector to the end
    * [ $ p ] to check that the partition size if to 7G
+ [ $ w ] to write the modification on the disk
+ [ $ fdisk -l ] will show that we have two partion on the disk

Format the partition of file system (2.5 in the Bible):
+ [ $ mkfs -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 \
    && mkfs -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb3 ] (not sure about "ext4", here the partitions are 
                                   small partitions, then "ext2" seems to be more
                                   appropriate, but "ext4" is laster version of
                                   ext file, use nano-second timestamps and has
                                   a speed improvements)
                                   -> "/dev/sdb" & "/dev/sdb3" is the LFS partition
+ [ $ mkswap /dev/sdb2 ] -> Initialize the swap partition

Set up the LFS environment variable :
+ [ $ export LFS=/mnt/lfs ] (value used in the Bible)
                            -> the variable will be used on a lot of commands.

Mounting the new partition (2.7 in the Bible) :
+ [ $ mkdir -pv $LFS ] -> create the mount file of root partition
+ [ $ mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb3 $LFS ] -> "sdb3" is the root partition
+ [ $ mkdir -v $LFS/boot ] -> create the mount file of /boot partition
+ [ $ mount -v -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 $LFS/boot ] -> "sdb1" is the /boot partition
+ Set the swap partition to on:
    * [ $ /sbin/swapon -v /dev/sdb2 ] "sdb2" is the swap partition
